# Data Science Fundamentals: NumPy & Pandas with MovieLens Case Study  

## Project Overview  
This project is all about building a solid foundation in **data science with Python**.  
Using the **MovieLens dataset**, I explored how to work with **NumPy** and **Pandas** to analyze data, uncover patterns, and draw meaningful insights.  

The dataset provides a great real-world example, combining user demographics, movie information, and ratings, the perfect playground for practicing data wrangling, analysis, and visualization.  

## Objective  
The main goal was to analyze the MovieLens datasets (movies, users, and ratings) to:  
- Understand how movies are rated and identify rating trends.  
- Explore genre preferences and user behavior.  
- Investigate the connection between demographics (age, gender, occupation) and ratings.  

## Dataset Breakdown  

### Users  
- **943 users**, each with details like age, gender, occupation, and zip code.  
- **Key findings:**  
  - The average user age is **34** (range: 7â€“73).  
  - Zip code values stood out as an area worth deeper investigation.  

### Movies  
- **1,680 movies** with titles, release dates, and up to 18 genre tags.  
- **Key findings:**  
  - Movies often belong to multiple genres.  
  - **Drama** and **Comedy** were the most common.  

### Ratings  
- **100,000 ratings** linked to users and movies, each with a timestamp.  
- **Key findings:**  
  - The average movie rating is **3.53** out of 5.  

## Insights & Discoveries  

- **Genre Trends:**  
  - Movies are spread across 18 genres.  
  - About half belong to more than one genre.  
  - Drama and Comedy dominate in volume.  

- **Genre Preferences:**  
  - **Film-Noir** had the highest average rating (3.92).  
  - **Fantasy** scored the lowest (3.21).  
  - Overall, 72% of genres received ratings above the global average of 3.5.  

- **Movie Favorites:**  
  - By average rating: *Great Day in Harlem, A* and *Prefontaine*.  
  - By popularity: *Star Wars* had the highest number of ratings.  

- **Demographics & Ratings:**  
  - The dataset is **71% male**.  
  - Men and women rated movies almost the same (~3.53).  
  - Non-working users gave the highest ratings.  
  - Healthcare workers gave the lowest, especially female healthcare workers.  

## Skills Applied  

- Data cleaning and preprocessing with **NumPy** and **Pandas**.  
- Exploring datasets with descriptive statistics and summaries.  
- Deriving insights from real-world data.  
- Understanding relationships between **demographics, genres, and ratings**.  

## Why This Project Matters  
This case study shows how raw data can be transformed into meaningful insights.  
It highlights:  
- How to clean and structure real-world datasets.  
- Ways to uncover hidden patterns in data.  
- The importance of combining technical skills with curiosity-driven exploration.  

Most importantly, it lays the groundwork for **more advanced machine learning and AI applications**, where understanding the data is always the first step.
